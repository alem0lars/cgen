# CGen

CGen is the next **localized Curriculum Vitae** editor, both for hackers and end-users.

## Installation

Via rubygems

    $ gem install cgen

Via homebrew

    $ brew install cgen

## Usage

CGen provides two editing modes:
1. **Hacking Mode**
2. **Normal Mode**

### Hacking Mode

This is where CGen shrines, by allowing users to **just provide the data** and let the system do the rest. This system comes with *extensibility* in mind, by providing different level of customization

### Normal Mode

This is primarly for non-hackers. In this mode the curriculum is edited by using a GUI.

*This mode is still in development: not released yet*.
